Lovely cast. Sandra is the probably best I've seen her, Hugh is spectacular, and John makes such a perfect Raoul. Head blocking kind of gets a little annoying at times. Other than that, good quality.

Shot from what looks like the second row of the orchestra, which offers some brilliant close-ups; another one of those chandelier malfunction they pause playback for a bit to remedy the situation during the overture

phantom asked of you,'

A Starts at Carlotta's 'Think of Me'. Married couple Gary and Elizabeth have great chemistry as Phantom/Christine. Kim may be my favourite Carlotta.

Jeff Keller, George Lee Andrews, Anne Runolfsson, Marilyn Caskey, Larry Wayne Morbitt, Kara Klein
<BR>A Rebecca is a bit pitchy but I love the way she portrays Christine. Hugh is a master, he brings so much intricacy to Erik in turn giving every other actor a lot to work off of. The moment after the kiss in Final Lair is nothing short of genius on both Rebecca and Hugh's part. <BR>
Highlights,  around 80 minutes
(focuses on the main trio, most ensemble numbers (Notes, Masquerade) are cut.)

<u>Note:</u> Contains an incredible flub, Buquet fails to appear for "Magical Lasso" and McFadden covers the whole thing, causing Giry to threaten her daughter.<br>
B+ Shaky video that comes in and out of focus. Jennifer's voice is boyant and Jason makes a suitable Raoul. Gary is Gary: pretty flawless in his representation of a much more wounded and vulnerable Phantom than some.

<u>Masters' Notes</u>:
This was filmed after the November cast change, with a new Christine alternate. Small flub where Christine did not quite manage to remove Phantom's hood. Prologue has quite a few blackouts, and another small blackout in act 2 when Madame Giry confesses to Raoul (all due to late seating), but otherwise very clear and unobstructed. Complete show including curtain call and BCEFA speech. I don't know why I film the best (quality wise) in phantom, but this show is well shot - tightly focused and very steady.

Excellent capture of first black actor to portray the Phantom on Broadway and Sierra's return. Norm and Sierra were divine in the roles and such a pleasure to watch! Still such an extravagant and luscious production after all these years! A

Derrick Davis,<i> Kaitlyn Davis (u/s Christine)</i>, Jordan Craig, Trista Moldovan, Prince Waldman, David Benoit, Tynan Davis (u/s Madame Giry), Phumzile Sojola, Emily Ramirez. A strong tour cast lead by a very strong Phantom. Kaitlyn makes a stunning and beautiful Christine. <br>
A good capture with no blackouts, minimal washout, and no major obstructions. The lighting of this show is difficult and some scenes turned out darker. One head that is only visible in wide shots. It is filmed in 16:9, with a mix of wides, mediums, and close-ups. The sound is excellent and includes curtain call with an obstructed BCEFA speech. A
<em>personal note: Have seen Derrick/Jordan/Trista/Phumzile Emily cast</em>
